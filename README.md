### Description:

Picture this. It's a frosty winter morning, and you wake up to the sound of snow pattering against your window. You need to leave for work in ten minutes, and you forgot to pick out your outfit last night! You're so cozy, but you need to get out of your bed, walk on your cold floor, and spend a few minutes browsing through your closet. Is your blue shirt in the laundry? Yes, it is. But you just spent three minutes looking for it.

So sad.

With Ensemble you wont have this problem. You can access your whole closet at the tip of your fingers. Say goodbye to cold, hardwood floors and hello to warm feet in your fluffy blanket.

Ensemble allows you to add, delete and constantly virtually update your closet.
